# üß† Graph-based Reasoning for Question Answering

This repository contains the implementation of **KnowGPT** with enhancements for **Commonsense Question Answering (QA)**, integrating **ConceptNet** knowledge graph, **Deep Reinforcement Learning (PRL)**, and **Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)**-based prompt optimization.

## üöÄ Overview

Hallucination remains a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive QA tasks. This project aims to reduce hallucination and improve reasoning by using:

- **Knowledge Graphs (ConceptNet 5.7)** for factual grounding  
- **Graph-based path reasoning** with Reinforcement Learning  
- **Adaptive prompt construction** using Multi-Armed Bandit  
- **Hierarchical Prompting Taxonomy (HPT)** for structured prompts  

Target dataset: **CommonsenseQA**  
LLM: GPT-3.5 / GPT-4 (via OpenAI API)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.8+
- `transformers`
- `sentence-transformers`
- `networkx`
- `scikit-learn`
- `openai`
- 
If you want to run/train on **google colab**, you can get the file in the file **KnowGPT_colab.ipynb**.

Notes: You must also export your OpenAI API key!

üì¶ System Architecture
The project is structured into modular components:

- `ConceptNetGraphBuilder`: Builds the knowledge graph (as a MultiDiGraph) from ConceptNet triples.
- `KGEnvRL`: Defines a custom RL environment over the KG for path reasoning.
- `PolicyNet`: A neural policy network that learns to select paths toward target answers.
- `PromptConstructorMAB`: Manages multiple prompt templates and selects the best one using multi-armed bandit strategy.
